# File Handling
The `File` class is a PHP class that provides a convenient and easy-to-use API for working with files and directories in PHP. With this class, you can perform a wide range of file-related operations, such as reading and writing to files, creating and deleting directories, moving and copying files, and more.

All the methods in this class are static methods, meaning that you can use them without creating an instance of the class. This makes it easy to use the class from anywhere in your code.

Overall, the File class provides a powerful and user-friendly API for working with files and directories in PHP. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced PHP developer, this class is a valuable tool for simplifying file-related tasks and improving the reliability and performance of your code.
